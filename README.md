## About the project
We got the inspiration of this idea with the help of our fellow friends who wanted to have good knowledge as well as relevant skills in different **Programming languages** and **frameworks**. They wanted a single platform to access the **best resources** available in the internet, so we came up with an idea to build this platform.

**HashCode** is a web and app based platform where the we provide the **best-handpicked courses** from the internet at one place of different branches. Students who will use the platform can view **various courses** and test their knowledge.

## Web stack
